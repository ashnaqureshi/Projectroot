    initiative was developed through the collaboration of a Steering Committee and the sponsor of the initiative, Pfizer Inc. This collaborative effort is referred to as PROJECT ROOT.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PROJECT ROOT Steering Committee is a diverse, distinguished panel of professionals who seek to make a real difference with respect to the problem of prescription opioid abuse. Comprising clinicians, academicians, and patient advocates, the Committee met to discuss the scope of the problem and, importantly, to begin developing practical approaches to the problem of opioid prescribing for patients with chronic pain. The information, tools, and resources you will find here are a product of the Steering Committee&rsquo;s work and their collaboration with the sponsor of the initiative, Pfizer Inc.
